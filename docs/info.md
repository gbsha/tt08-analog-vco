## How it works

A voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) using 4 differential stages and a bias controller. At each stage, the outputs are low-pass filtered by nfet transistors connected as capacitors to ground. 

The first analog pin `ua[0]` can be used as input to control the oscillation frequency by changing the gate voltages of nfet current sources connected to ground. The second analog pin `ua[1]` can be used as output pin to monitor the corresponding gate voltage of the pfet current sources connected to VDD as generated by the bias controller. Alternatively, the second analog pin `ua[1]` can be used as input pin to overwrite the bias controller.

The 4 differential stages provide in total 8 tap signals with phase differences of 360/8. The 8 tap signals are output at the 8 digital output pins `uo[0]` to `uo[7]`. *NB:* the 8 tap signals are ordered by wiring convenience, not by phase.

*TODO: provide table with pinnumber to phase mapping.*

## How to test

Connect a control voltage or curent to the analog input pin(s) and observe the oscillating signals at the digital output pins.

## External hardware

DC power supply for the control voltage/current, oscilloscope for monitoring the output.
